<p>The purpose of Project Cards is two folds. During development, it helps the developer think about the problem in a structured way w.r. t framing the problem, assessing the business value, viability, and many other aspects.</p>
<p>It can also serve as a document giving a high level overview of the system developed and deployed. With proper versioning, one can also see the evolution of the problem. It is meant to be a high level document and as details emerge, documents such Model Cards and Data Cards can be linked.</p>
<p>The following are the different sections of the Project Cards.</p>
<p>This notebook uses tags to render the output. Each call has a tag. There are three tags: objective, instruction, response. The cell with objective tag explains the purpose of this project card. Cells with instruction tag, are the key sections of the document that must be filled. A cell following immediately will have a tag response. You only fill the cell with response tag. DO NOT MODIFY the cells with tag instruction. Of course, feel free to modify to your needs. Once the format is agreed upon, stick to it.</p>

<section id="metrics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="metrics">Metrics</h2>
<p><em>How will the solution be evaluated - What are the ML metrics? What are the business metrics? Link <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993">Model Card</a> when sufficient details become available (start small but early)</em></p>
<p>To evaluate the performance of the ML model for the recommendation system for housing, we can use the following metrics:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Precision</strong>: Precision measures the proportion of correctly recommended houses out of all the houses recommended. It helps assess the accuracy of the recommendations and the model’s ability to avoid false positives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recall</strong>: Recall measures the proportion of correctly recommended houses out of all the houses that should have been recommended. It helps assess the model’s ability to avoid false negatives and capture all relevant houses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>F1 Score</strong>: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balanced measure of the model’s performance, taking into account both precision and recall.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mean Average Precision (MAP)</strong>: MAP calculates the average precision across different levels of recommendation. It considers the order of the recommended houses and rewards models that rank more relevant houses higher.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)</strong>: NDCG measures the quality of the ranking of the recommended houses. It takes into account both the relevance of the recommended houses and their position in the ranking.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hit Rate</strong>: Hit rate measures the proportion of users for whom at least one relevant house was recommended. It helps assess the coverage of the recommendation system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)</strong>: MRR calculates the average reciprocal rank of the first relevant house in the recommendation list. It provides a measure of the model’s ability to rank the most relevant houses higher.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User Satisfaction</strong>: User satisfaction can be measured through surveys or feedback from users. It helps assess the overall user experience and satisfaction with the recommended houses.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These metrics can be calculated using a holdout or cross-validation approach, where a subset of the data is used for evaluation. It is important to consider both the ML metrics and the business metrics to ensure that the recommendation system meets the needs and expectations of the users.</p>

<li><p>Proximity Data: Data on nearby amenities such as schools, colleges, marketplaces, hospitals, parks, and transportation facilities. This information helps assess the convenience and accessibility of the location.</p></li>
<li><p>Amenities Data: Details about the amenities available within the house or the housing complex, such as swimming pools, gyms, parking spaces, security systems, and other facilities.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Collecting this data can be done through various sources, including real estate websites, property listings, public APIs, and data scraping techniques. It is important to ensure the data is accurate, up-to-date, and representative of the target housing market.</p>
<p>Additionally, data preprocessing steps may be required to clean and transform the data into a suitable format for training the recommendation model. This may involve handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature engineering to extract relevant information.</p>
<p>By gathering and preparing this data, we can build a robust housing recommendation system that considers various factors and preferences to provide accurate and personalized recommendations to users.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="compute-resources">Compute Resources</h3>
<p><em>What type of compute resources needed to train and serve?</em></p>
<p>To train and serve the housing recommendation model, you would need the following computer resources:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Hardware</strong>: A computer with sufficient computational power is required for training the model. This can include a high-performance CPU or GPU, depending on the complexity of the model and the size of the dataset. GPUs are particularly useful for accelerating the training process, especially for deep learning models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Memory</strong>: Sufficient memory (RAM) is necessary to handle the data and model during training. The amount of memory required depends on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the model. Larger datasets and more complex models generally require more memory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Storage</strong>: Adequate storage space is needed to store the dataset, model files, and any other necessary resources. The size of the storage depends on the size of the dataset and the number of models being trained and served.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software</strong>: You will need software tools and libraries for training and serving the model. This can include machine learning frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, as well as any additional libraries or packages required for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and deployment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Development Environment</strong>: A Jupyter Notebook or any other development environment is needed to write and execute the code for training the model. This environment should have the necessary software dependencies installed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Networking</strong>: A stable internet connection is required for downloading datasets, accessing external APIs or services, and serving the model to users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scalability</strong>: If you anticipate a large number of users or a growing dataset, you may need to consider scalable infrastructure options such as cloud computing platforms or distributed computing frameworks to handle the increased workload.</p></li>
