    "To train and serve the housing recommendation model, you would need the following computer resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hardware**: A computer with sufficient computational power is required for training the model. This can include a high-performance CPU or GPU, depending on the complexity of the model and the size of the dataset. GPUs are particularly useful for accelerating the training process, especially for deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory**: Sufficient memory (RAM) is necessary to handle the data and model during training. The amount of memory required depends on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the model. Larger datasets and more complex models generally require more memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Storage**: Adequate storage space is needed to store the dataset, model files, and any other necessary resources. The size of the storage depends on the size of the dataset and the number of models being trained and served.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Software**: You will need software tools and libraries for training and serving the model. This can include machine learning frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, as well as any additional libraries or packages required for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Development Environment**: A Jupyter Notebook or any other development environment is needed to write and execute the code for training the model. This environment should have the necessary software dependencies installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Networking**: A stable internet connection is required for downloading datasets, accessing external APIs or services, and serving the model to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Scalability**: If you anticipate a large number of users or a growing dataset, you may need to consider scalable infrastructure options such as cloud computing platforms or distributed computing frameworks to handle the increased workload.\n"
